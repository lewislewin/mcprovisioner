This is a python script with the objective of being able to provision and launch entirely self sustaining and connectable mincraft servers on amazon AWS EC2 instances.

The provisioned servers should have a basic web interface for stopping, starting and refreshing the minecraft server as well as uniquely generated access credentials that are displayed to the user when first starting the site but never again.

The type of instance provisioned would be configuarable.
